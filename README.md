# ChatBotFlask

This code creates a simple chatbot server using Flask, which communicates with OpenAI's GPT model using the OpenAI API. The server listens for incoming POST requests with a user input text and returns a chatbot-generated response.

## To run and use this code, follow these steps:

#### Requirements:

Make sure you have Python installed. If not, download and install Python from the official website: https://www.python.org/downloads/

Install the required packages, namely Flask, Flask-CORS, and OpenAI. You can do this using pip:

**Copy code:**


    pip install Flask Flask-CORS openai

**API Key**:

You need an API key from OpenAI to use their service. Replace the placeholder api_key value in the code with your actual API key:

makefile
Copy code
```python
api_key = "your_actual_api_key_here"
```
Save the code:

Save the code in a file named app.py.

**Run the server**:

Open a terminal (or command prompt) and navigate to the directory where you saved app.py. Run the following command:

Copy code


    python app.py

You should see output similar to this, indicating that the server is running:

csharp
Copy code


    Running on http://127.0.0.1:5000/ (Press CTRL+C to quit)
    Send a request to the chatbot:

You can now send a POST request to the /chatbot endpoint with a JSON payload containing a key input and a text value. You can use tools like Postman or curl to send the request.

Example with curl:



    json
    Copy code
    curl -X POST -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d '{"input": "tell me a joke"}' http://127.0.0.1:5000/chatbot
    The server will return a JSON object with the key response and the chatbot-generated response as the value.
    

### Code explanation:

**Import necessary packages**: Flask for creating the web server, CORS for handling cross-origin resource sharing, and OpenAI for interacting with the GPT model.

1. Initialize the Flask app and enable CORS for all origins, methods, and headers.

3. Define a function chatbot_response that takes user input and the API key, then calls the OpenAI API to get a response from the GPT model.

5. Create an endpoint /chatbot that listens for POST requests. It extracts the user input from the request, gets a chatbot response using the chatbot_response function, and returns the response as a JSON object.

7. Run the Flask app in debug mode when the script is run directly.
